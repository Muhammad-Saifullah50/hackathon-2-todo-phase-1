  If you want me to make sensible defaults for these, here's what I'd suggest:                     
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                   
  - Navigation flow: After adding a task, return to main menu or show the task?       show all     
tasks.                                                                                             
  - Back/Cancel options: Can users go back from any submenu?    yes absolutely

  You mentioned viewing tasks in tables, but:                                                      
  - Filter options in view menu:

user should have options to view all, pending or completed tasks, then show them.

  You said Title max is 10 characters - this seems very restrictive. A task title like "Buy        
  groceries" is 13 characters. Did you mean:                                                       
  - 10 words?                                                                                      
  - 100 characters?                                                                                
  - Or truly 10 characters (very short)?

  1. Mark as complete (shows only pending tasks)                                                   
  2. Mark as incomplete (shows only completed tasks)

  - Update task → ✓ Success → return where? (main menu? view menu?)

  When updating, you said "anyone can be updated" (either title or description). How does user     
  choose?

  You said "Integration tests for full workflows?" but didn't answer. Should we include:           
  - Full workflow tests (add → update → complete → delete)?                                        
  - Or just unit tests for models and storage?

  - Aim for 100% code coverage?

  - No specific coverage requirement, just all tests pass?

  You said Title max is 10 characters - this seems very restrictive. A task title like "Buy        
groceries" is 13 characters. Did you mean:                                                         
  - 10 words?

  You said "8 char uuid at time of creation". To clarify:

  - But what if two UUIDs have same first 8 chars? (rare but possible)  when generating a uuid,    
 slice it to 8 characters and save.
